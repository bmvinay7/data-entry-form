# üîß Quick Fix for 403 Error

## üö® The Issue
The form is getting a 403 error when submitting to Google Apps Script. This usually means:
1. **Deployment settings are wrong** in Google Apps Script
2. **"Who has access" is not set to "Anyone"**
3. **Script needs to be redeployed**

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Check Google Apps Script Deployment
1. **Go to your Google Apps Script**: https://script.google.com
2. **Open your project**
3. **Click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Manage deployments"**
4. **Click the pencil icon** (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit
5. **CRITICAL**: Make sure "Who has access" is set to **"Anyone"** (NOT "Anyone with Google account")
6. **Click "Deploy"**

### 2. Test the Script URL Directly
Paste this in your browser:
```
https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyYsucAmavurfFVSW-umvRd27DsLZFdRk25UkEJ9wwX-ABT8Oe2aX7zliQuNswnDOAvsA/exec
```

**Expected Result**: JSON response with "Google Apps Script is working correctly!"
**If you see error**: The deployment is wrong

### 3. Updated Frontend Code
I've updated `main.js` with a dual approach:
- **First tries**: `no-cors` fetch (bypasses CORS preflight)
- **Fallback**: Improved iframe method
- **Both methods**: Should work around the 403 error

## üß™ Test Again
1. **Redeploy your Google Apps Script** with "Anyone" access
2. **Test the script URL** directly in browser
3. **Try your form** again - should work without 403 errors

## üéØ Root Cause
The 403 error happens when Google Apps Script redirects to `script.googleusercontent.com` because:
- **Wrong deployment settings** (most common)
- **Script not properly deployed** as web app
- **Access restrictions** preventing anonymous access

**Fix the deployment settings and it should work! üöÄ**
