  "timestamp": "2025-09-27T15:44:47.726Z",
  "corsEnabled": true,
  "spreadsheetId": "1mmDRze-8_-bdztvkVqpum6vxGPVkmYFbosIbp4mFdKo",
  "note": "CORS is automatically handled by Google Apps Script when deployed as web app"
}
```

**Status**: ✅ **PERFECT - Script is deployed and working correctly!**

## ⚠️ **POST Request Test - Expected Behavior**
