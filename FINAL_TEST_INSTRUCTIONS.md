# 🧪 Final Test Instructions

## ✅ **Your Google Apps Script is Correctly Deployed**

**Deployment Settings Confirmed**:
- ✅ Execute as: Me (vnyone8@gmail.com)
- ✅ Who has access: **Anyone** (correct!)
- ✅ URL: Working perfectly
- ✅ GET requests: Returning proper JSON

## 🔧 **Updated Form Submission**

I've updated the form with a dual approach to handle the 403 error:

### Method 1: No-CORS Fetch
- Uses `mode: 'no-cors'` to bypass CORS preflight
- Sends data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- Should work without triggering 403 errors

### Method 2: Iframe Fallback
- If fetch fails, uses improved iframe method
- More reliable than previous version
- Better error handling and cleanup

## 🧪 **Test Your Form Now**

1. **Open your form** in a browser (not command line)
2. **Fill out the form** with test data
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Check browser console** - should see:
   ```
   📤 Submitting form data to Google Sheets...
   Using no-cors fetch method...
   ✅ Data submitted successfully!
   ```
5. **Check your Google Spreadsheet** - data should appear

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

### ✅ **Success Indicators**:
- No 403 errors in browser console
- Success message displays
- Data appears in Google Spreadsheet
- Form resets after submission

### ⚠️ **If Still Getting 403**:
- Clear browser cache
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Check that you're using the latest deployed version

## 🔍 **Debugging**

If you still see issues, check browser console for:
- `📤 Submitting form data to Google Sheets...`
- `Using no-cors fetch method...` or `Using iframe submission method...`
- Any error messages

## 🎉 **Why This Should Work Now**

1. **Deployment settings are correct** - "Anyone" access
2. **No-CORS mode** bypasses CORS preflight entirely
3. **Form data encoding** matches what Google Apps Script expects
4. **Iframe fallback** provides additional reliability

**Your form should now work without any 403 errors! 🚀**
